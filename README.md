Project description/outline:

The stock market has been through a lot in the past few months, mainly the major crypto market plunge in July. Your nephew is a new skeptical crypto investor whose interest into the market grew after some coins hit their highest market value around May 2021.
As a relative to this young crypto enthusiast aware of his impatience and investment strategy (short term) you asked  him to provide you with 5 coins that he thinks would have helped help his portfolio grow in a year if he invested the same a year ago. The main aim of this portfolio is to come up with an analysis that will be easy for him to understand his different investments.



Research questions to answer:

Which coin has the most growth? In the short run (0-2 years)? In the long-run (5-10years)?
Which coin performs better?
To achieve 15% of return over a year which crypto should you invest in?
To achieve 30% of return over 5 years which crypto should you invest in?
Which coin has suffered the most losses?
What is the most traded coin?
Does the volume traded influence the price?
Does a coin value affect its trade?
What portfolio offers the best Sharpe Ratio?
