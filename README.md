Project description/outline:

The stock market has been through a lot in the past few months, mainly the major crypto market plunge in July. Your nephew is a new skeptical crypto investor whose interest into the market grew after some coins hit their highest market value around May 2021.
As a relative to this young crypto enthusiast aware of his impatience and investment strategy (short term) you asked  him to provide you with 5 coins that he thinks would have helped help his portfolio grow in a year if he invested the same a year ago. The main aim of this portfolio is to come up with an analysis that will be easy for him to understand his different investments.



Research questions to answer:

## Does a coin value affect its trading volume?
*We concluded that there is no direct relationships between price and trading volume. 
## What are the most unpredictable coin?
*The most unpredictable coins were found out to be mainly the low caps coins (Sushi, Doge)
## Which coin has grown the most? 
*A Growth dominated by lower capitalization and Meme coins observed from the plot of the cummulative returns over the period of *oct-2020* to *oct-2021*, which shows SUSHI and DogeCoin as the assets with the highest levels of growth. One argument in favor of including these types of assets in a portfolio in combination with blue chip assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum.*
## What is the most traded coin ? 
*Bitcoin is the most traded coin of all the portfolio*
## What is the optimal portfolio for reducing exposure to risk?
*In this part of our annalysis, we kept Tether(the stable coin) to maintain the lowest risk possible. The results included of the minimum Volatility portfolio annualized portfolio return was 405.77% with an annualized volatility of 27.99%. How ever, one common attribute found in both portfolio weighs (weigh of minimum volatility, weigh with the highest sharpe ratio), Tether makes up for more that 50% of the porfolio making both the safest. *
