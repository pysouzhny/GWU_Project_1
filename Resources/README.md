Project description/outline:

The crypto market is generally known for its high profit returns. Despite the market's volatility, the growth in different coins' market caps encourage more people to defy their fears.
As an  excited new crypto investor, after learning about the coin operations the next factor that determines where you allocate your funds is the investment strategy to follow (long-term or short-term) and the expected return. 
Deciding whether to invest in a developed coin whose USD purchasing  value is high and the possible return on investment is almost certain. Or investing in a promising upcoming coin with a relatively low USD purchasing value along with the uncertainty of a return on investment is another hard decision you have to make.
This project’s aim is to provide data that will help a new crypto investor decide in a more efficient way which investment strategy to go with and what coins to invest in comparing coins such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, Dogecoin, Sushiswap,Tether. 

Research questions to answer:

Which coin has the most growth? In the short run (0-2 years)? In the long-run (5-10years)?
Which coin performs better?
To achieve 15% of return over a year which crypto should you invest in?
To achieve 30% of return over 5 years which crypto should you invest in?
Which coin has suffered the most losses?
What is the most traded coin?
Does the volume traded influence the price?
Does a coin value affect its trade?
What portfolio offers the best Sharpe Ratio?
